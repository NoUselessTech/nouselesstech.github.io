## Overview

In one of my attempts to get a college degree, I came across this lesson and have used it in every role since. Anyone who undersands the principal connections between technology, data, information, processes, and people can affect great change in their world. 

## Component Break down

### Technology

Technology represents the software, hardware, and everything in between that an organization uses to conduct business. This is the primary domain for cybersecurity practicitions, IT/Network engineers, and other roles primarily oriented towards to implementation, management, and support of technology.

### Data

Data represents isolated facts or raw values, typically stored on Technology in some form or fashion. Data can be stored within a database, document files, or even scratched down on a piece of paper.

### Information

Information is data with context which enhances its value. By combining different streams of data, organizations can make critical decisions or implement business logic to drive organizational success with qualitative or quantitative information.

### Processes

Processes are the operating procedures used to leverage information to conduct business. Without processes, information may not be used in a timely fashion resulting in lost revenue or opportunities for the organization.

### People

People are the greatest assets to an organization. From the entry level workers to the top of the C-Suite, people are the driving force that utilize technology, data, information, and processes to manifest real world value.  

## Model

```
-------------- Increase in Business Value ------------ >

| Technology | Data | Information | Processes | People |

< ----------- Decrease in change resistance  -----------
```

## Take Aways

### People are important

With the exception of a few niche industries, people are the most important part of the business and the most resistant to change. This means that any proposal which require changing the behavior of end users must be very carefully considered. Changes which streamline the user experience are usually fairly easy to implement, but neutral or negative impacts will require significant justification.

### Tech fights can be a distraction

It can be easy to get caught into a fight over what the "right" technology is. Ultimately, there's likely many different technologies that work, and what's most important is that a quality solution is provided at the right time to support the right data to generate the right information. Languages, frameworks, code source type, etc. are all distractions that very rarely impact the actual business in its day to day.

*Note: I'm not saying that technology doesn't have future business impacts. Good architecture and engineering should think about the strategy of technology, however, it's seldom that e C-Suite or board needs to be bothered by React vs Vue arguments as they are more focsued on features/services/products than background technology.* 

## Conclusion

If you find yourself trying to affect change and you're struggling with making progress, identify where you're getting stuck. If changing the technology is difficult, look at the data to understand what it needs from the tech stack. If your organization is struggling with data, try to identify what information would help business processes. If you're organization processes are lacking, understand the people who are running the business and identify ways to streamline or enhance the processes.

If you find yourself trying to get people to change to adopt a technology you like, make sure there's value for the upstream in the model to make it worth their while. Without upstream value, the technology change will need to wait.
